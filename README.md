# Riemann Metrics for Blueshift

[Blueshift](https://github.com/uswitch/blueshift) is a service to provide an easier S3-oriented integration with Amazon Redshift. This library provides [Metrics](http://metrics.codahale.com/) integration for Riemann suitable for integrating with Blueshift.

## Usage

Assuming you've already got an Uberjar built for Blueshift you just need to build the metrics uberjar and add it to Blueshift's classpath.

To configure the reporter add the following to Blueshift's configuration file:

    :telemetry {:reporters [uswitch.blueshift.telemetry.riemann/riemann-metrics-reporter]}
    :riemann {:host "localhost"
             :port 5555}
